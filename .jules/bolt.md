## 2024-05-20 - [Add Debouncer to ShadInput]
**Learning:** Flutter analyzer failures around 'uri_does_not_exist' usually indicate an issue with dependency resolution or Flutter version mismatch, which is a known issue outlined in the system memory (Dart SDK requirement higher than local). This prevents clean 'flutter analyze' outputs. The code itself for debouncing 'ShadInput' 'onChanged' events directly addresses performance by avoiding expensive filter evaluations on every keystroke.
**Action:** Use 'flutter analyze --no-pub' but interpret the 'uri_does_not_exist' errors for packages/internal files as symptoms of the SDK mismatch rather than code logic errors.

## 2024-05-20 - [Add Debouncer to ShadInput Review]
**Learning:** When creating a Debouncer for search inputs with a 'clear' button, the debouncer timer must be cancelled in the clear button's 'onPressed' callback, otherwise the delayed input will overwrite the cleared state. Adding comments is explicitly part of the required guidelines.
**Action:** Always document optimizations in comments in code. Remember to handle timer cancellation on clear UI actions to prevent state race conditions.
## 2026-06-02 - [Hoist List Filtering String Mutations]
**Learning:** Redundant memory allocations like `.toLowerCase()` executed directly inside high-frequency loop boundaries like `.where()` for UI search handlers cause minor performance drags and jitter as lists grow.
**Action:** Extracted static string conversions out of the scope of closures and iterators.
